i dont exist in my body. i exist somewhere else. my body is merely the way
in which i access the world. the same way that i use my computer to access the internet.
i exist somewhere else. i sit my body in front of the computer, which is standing still,
and that is how i access the internet. online, i move around freely. but the physical
computer stays put. similarly, my body stays in the same place, while my mind roams
freely through it. i access the world through the monitors of my eyes. if my body
needs moved, then it is moved. if my computer is moved, then it is moved. the 
computer is turned off for travel. I turn my body off for travel as well. I am not
inside of it, i am somewhere else.

and one day, both will fall apart, and decay, and the parts will be recycled.
metal will become something else. carbon and flesh too will become something else.

my computer is made from parts that used to be other things. So too is my body.
the materials that make it up are not mine. i am borrowing them. today, they are
a body. tomorrow, they may be something else.

I am not inside my body. I am somewhere else.
