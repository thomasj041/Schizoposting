my body is decaying around me. it is falling apart too quickly. my access to this world
wanes. there is still so much i want to do, but my body, my access point, prevents me
from it. but isnt that the human experience? Every human wants to do the same things.
history is repeated over and over again every single day. Multitudes want to go to
the same places, eat the same foods, experience the same things. People stand in lines
for once in a lifetime events. But is it once in a lifetime? They are all standing,
they all experience it in the same day. Hundreds of times in one lifetime, spread
across the individuals. 

Why do I also need to do these things? Why do i seek them out, if others already have?
