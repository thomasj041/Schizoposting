the internet is built on decay. thousands of dead websites, written by dead people,
hosted on dying servers. Photographs litter the depths, the faces they depict
rotting in the ground. The photographers already forgotten. In order to build an AI,
they used those images. Do the family members know? Why would it matter if they did?

In order to make a new website, you have to study those who came before. But nobody
visits those places anymore.

Hundreds of thousands of homeless people and millions of abandoned homes. The internet
mirrors this. Billions of abandoned pages. They rot away. Computers move on, but the sites
stay in place. Frozen. Eventually, they stop being legible, as the code rots and wastes away.

Magtape sits in garages, being eaten by bugs. Do the trees know that their pulp was made
into the internet? Does anyone realize how much history has been lost already?

On a damaged hard disc sits videos of myself as a child. She's talking and laughing with friends.
Her words were caught on the wind, physically moving the molecules of air. The waves
died out years ago and disapeared. One day, the bytes will too. Will her body fail first? Or
will she continue moving after her digital footprint washes away with the tide?
