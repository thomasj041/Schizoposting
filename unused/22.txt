who are you? are you reading this? 
are you in control?

are there ghosts in the internet? rotting, decaying corpses of websites, propped
up for decades after the obituary is written, gawked at by the masses
one day you will join them
do you want to join them?

april 22nd

how old were you when it all happened?
