I am ancient. I am as old as the universe itself. What makes up me, makes up the
universe. It has always existed and it always will. Why then, did I only gain
conciousness upon being born? Why can i only watch the stars through my own eyes?
When my body shuts down, the stars will still exist, and other eyes will still look
upon them. Will i join in with their eyes in a different form?

When my body becomes others, will they remember me?

Do i remember who my body used to be? Metal remembers its shape once bent and formed,
maybe so does the flesh which I inhabit.
